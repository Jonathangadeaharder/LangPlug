# Pylint configuration for LangPlug Backend
#
# This configuration is FOCUSED on code duplication and similarity checks only.
# Ruff handles all other linting (pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, etc.)
#
# Run with: pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc services/ api/ core/
# Pre-commit: Automatically runs on changed files

[MAIN]
# Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation
init-hook='import sys; sys.path.insert(0, ".")'

# Files or directories to be skipped
ignore=api_venv,venv,.venv,alembic/versions,tests,scripts

# Use multiple processes to speed up Pylint
jobs=4

# Pickle collected data for later comparisons
persistent=yes


[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# ONLY enable duplication and similarity checks
# Disable all other checks (handled by Ruff)
disable=all
enable=R0801   # duplicate-code: Similar lines in multiple files


[SIMILARITIES]
# Minimum lines number of a similarity.
# Lowering this increases false positives but catches smaller duplications
min-similarity-lines=6

# Ignore comments when computing similarities
ignore-comments=yes

# Ignore docstrings when computing similarities
ignore-docstrings=yes

# Ignore imports when computing similarities

# Signatures are removed from the similarity computation

[REPORTS]
# Set the output format

# Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages

[FORMAT]
# Maximum number of characters on a single line (should match Ruff/Black)
