src/components/VocabularyLibrary.tsx(826,25): error TS2352: Conversion of type 'VocabularyLibraryWord' to type 'Record<string, unknown>' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'VocabularyLibraryWord'.
