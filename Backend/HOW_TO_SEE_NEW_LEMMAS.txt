HOW TO SEE THE NEW LEMMAS (spaCy + Proper Name Filtering)
================================================================================

WHAT WAS FIXED:
  1. Backend always uses spaCy for lemmatization (no fallbacks)
  2. Backend filters out proper names (Berlin, Schmidt, etc.)
  3. Backend uses de_core_news_lg model for better accuracy
  4. Frontend always reprocesses chunks (no caching of old data)

WHY YOU'RE SEEING OLD DATA:
  - The screenshot shows vocabulary from an OLD processing run (before fixes)
  - The old vocabulary is stored in React component state
  - The backend can't retroactively update old vocabulary data

HOW TO SEE THE NEW LEMMAS:

Option 1: Refresh the page
  1. Refresh your browser page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
  2. Click on the same chunk again
  3. It will reprocess with the NEW backend code
  4. You should see "Lemma: traurig" (not "Lemma: trauriger")

Option 2: Select a different time range
  1. Select a different chunk or time range
  2. Process it
  3. New vocabulary will use the fixed backend code

WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER REPROCESSING:
  - "trauriger" -> "Lemma: traurig" (adjective base form)
  - "spricht" -> "Lemma: sprechen" (verb infinitive)
  - Proper names like "Berlin", "Schmidt" will NOT appear in vocabulary
  - Correct difficulty levels from database (A1, A2, B1, etc.)

VERIFICATION:
  Backend code is correct and tested:
    [GOOD] spaCy lemmatization: trauriger -> traurig
    [GOOD] Proper name detection: Berlin -> FILTERED OUT
    [GOOD] Vocabulary builder using new code

  Frontend now forces reprocessing:
    [GOOD] Chunks reset to isProcessed=false on page load
    [GOOD] No caching of old vocabulary
    [GOOD] Always calls backend to process fresh
