LAWS:
- Every first col entry is a single word
- for example "zum Beispiel" is not valid it has to be "zum" one entry and "Beispiel" another entry
- Warnung/Achtung is also not just a single word and needs two entries
- Let X,Y be in A1,A1,B1,B2,C1 (e.g. B1>A1 since the level is harder)
then that always implies x in A1 implies x not in B1 (no redundancy)
- each german word has to be in base form (lemma)
- no proper names or other non vocabulary words -> filter these out
- Make sure the Spanish translation is valid
- Only use file read and file edit tools, no scripts or other things. Do everything manually
- No duplicates
- groß kleinschreibung muss korrekt sein
