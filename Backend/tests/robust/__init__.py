Robust URL Testing Framework

This package contains test files that use the URL builder pattern to eliminate 
hardcoded URLs and prevent URL divergence issues in FastAPI tests.

All tests in this package use named routes and dynamic URL generation for 
maximum maintainability and resilience to route changes.
