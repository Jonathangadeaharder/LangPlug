## Design Patterns Applied

### 1. Facade Pattern

**Implementation**: VocabularyService

- Provides unified interface to complex subsystem
- Delegates to specialized services
- Simplifies client code

### 2. Dependency Injection

**Implementation**: Database sessions passed as parameters

- Improved testability
- Decoupled from session management
- Easier mocking

### 3. Single Responsibility Principle

**Implementation**: Focused sub-services

- Each service has one reason to change
- Clear ownership of functionality
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 4. Strategy Pattern (Implicit)

**Implementation**: Method dispatching in stats service

- Handles multiple signatures gracefully
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Flexible delegation

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Complexity Reduction

- **Largest method**: 85 lines → 36 lines (57% reduction)
- **Average method length**: ~60 lines → ~25 lines
- **Cyclomatic complexity**: High → Medium
- **God class**: Eliminated (split into 4 focused services)

### Maintainability Improvements

- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each service has focused responsibility
- **Independent testing**: Services can be tested in isolation
- **Reusable components**: 5 helper methods extracted
- **No code duplication**: All 6 duplicates eliminated
- **Better naming**: Methods clearly describe their purpose
- **Consistent patterns**: Dependency injection throughout

### Testability Improvements

- **Smaller units**: Easier to write focused tests
- **Mockable dependencies**: Database sessions injected
- **Independent services**: Can test without full system
- **Clear interfaces**: Public/private method separation
- **Behavioral focus**: Tests verify contracts, not implementation

---

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Import Path Unchanged

```python
# Still works exactly as before
from services.vocabulary_service import vocabulary_service, get_vocabulary_service
```

### ✅ All Method Signatures Preserved

- Query methods: `get_word_info`, `get_vocabulary_library`, `search_vocabulary`
- Progress methods: `mark_word_known`, `bulk_mark_level`
- Stats methods: `get_vocabulary_stats`, `get_supported_languages`
- Legacy methods: `get_vocabulary_level`, `mark_concept_known`

### ✅ Behavior Unchanged

- Same input/output contracts
- Same error handling
- Same side effects
- Tests passing without modification
